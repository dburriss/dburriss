### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**dburriss/dburriss** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an AI project
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS CDK
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on developer tooling
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my Kubernetes wrapper called [Overboard](https://devonburriss.me/overboard/)
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about how I used the wrong word for "sorry" in a foreign language
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DevonBurriss)
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Before getting into software I played in a band and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTFJK3y0j5g) is the only reference I have found to it online.
